## How to use pyRootHair

WIP.

## An in-depth dive into the pyRootHair workflow

This section is for users that are curious about how pyRootHair extracts traits from a given input image. In essence, this is a step by step process of the functions and logic within the source code. For this demonstration, I will be using the demo image `karim_demo.png` and the corresponding binary segmentation mask `karim_demo_mask.png`.

### Loading the necessary libraries

First, we import the required libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import imageio.v3 as iio

from skimage.measure import label, regionprops
from skimage.morphology import skeletonize
from skimage.transform import rotate, warp, PiecewiseAffineTransform
from scipy.ndimage import convolve
from scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean
from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline
from statsmodels.nonparametric.smoothers_lowess import lowess
```

For reference, the following versions were used at the time of writing this tutorial:

- python: 3.12.3
- numpy: 2.0.2
- pandas: 2.2.3
- matplotlib: 3.9.0
- imageiov3: 2.36.1
- scikit-image: 0.24.0
- scipy: 1.14.1
- statsmodels: 0.14.4

### Viewing the demo image and binary mask

Here, we first read in the raw image, and corresponding binary mask. The mask was generated by the integrated nnUNet segmentation model within pyRootHair.  

Since the mask is an array of [0, 1, 2], it will show up as a black image.   

This image was specifically chosen for a few reasons:

- Noise in the background (agar fragments)
- Root is inherently curved and not directly oriented downwards
- Presence of non-primary root sections

```python
image = iio.imread('demo/karim_demo.png')
mask = iio.imread('demo/karim_demo_mask.png')

fig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(15,10))
ax[0].imshow(image)
ax[0].set_title('Raw Image')
ax[1].imshow(mask)
ax[1].set_title('Binary Mask')
```
![alt text](demo/raw_binary.png)

From now on, I will process the binary mask.

### Root extraction

First, I will extract just the root from the binary mask. This is needed to determine how to pre-process the mask, including rotation and subsequent straightening. 

All pixels with the class label '2' is considered part of the root, and stored in a new variable `root_mask`.

```python
root_mask = (mask == 2)

plt.imshow(root_mask)
```
![alt text](demo/init_root_mask.png)

Next, I label the root, and define a very helpful function `clean_root_chunk()`. This function cleans up each chunk of root (or root hair) by removing all but the largest component present. By running this function on the root binary mask, only the largest root (the primary root we are interested in) is retained.

`clean_root_chunk()` is run if more than 1 root section is detected in the root mask. The function returns the cleaned root, and a count of the number of objects in the cleaned root mask.

Cleaning the mask is extremely important to calculate accurate parameters for mask manipulation, which will soon be evident.

```python
root_labeled_clean, count = label(root_mask, connectivity=2, return_num=True)

def clean_root_chunk(mask: 'NDArray') -> tuple[NDArray, list]:
    """
    Clean up each small section of the root mask by removing all but the largest area present
    """
    root_section_labeled, num_labels = label(mask, connectivity=2, return_num=True) # label the root mask
    
    if num_labels > 0:
        root_section_measured = regionprops(root_section_labeled) # measure the root section 
        max_label = max(root_section_measured, key=lambda x: x.area).label # get the label associated with the largest area in the measured section
        
        # mask out the smaller sections, retaining only the largest section
        clean_root_mask = root_section_labeled == max_label 
        root_section_labeled, _ = label(clean_root_mask, connectivity=2, return_num=True) # re label root 
        root_section_measured = regionprops(root_section_labeled) # re measure root section

        return root_section_labeled, root_section_measured

if count > 1:
    root_labeled_cleaned, count = clean_root_chunk(root_mask)

```
We can see the cleaned root mask now.

```python
plt.imshow(root_labeled_cleaned)
```
![alt text](demo/cleaned_root_mask.png)

### Skeletonizing the main root

Next, the main root is skeletonized, and all the co-ordinates of the skeleton are returned.

```python
skeleton = skeletonize(root_labeled_cleaned)

skeleton_y, skeleton_x = np.nonzero(skeleton)

plt.imshow(skeleton)
```
![alt text](demo/skeleton.png)

In this case, the skeletonized root is a near perfect representation of the midline of the initial root. However, in the even of poor root segmentation, the skeletonized root will be a poor approximation of the root midline. 

As such, the midline can be approximated by first fitting a spline to all co-ordinates of the skeleton:

```python
t_range  = np.arange(len(skeleton_x))
x_spline = CubicSpline(t_range, skeleton_x)(t_range)
y_spline = CubicSpline(t_range, skeleton_y)(t_range)
merged_spline = np.array(list(zip(x_spline, y_spline)))
```
The start and end points of the skeleton are calculated from the spline:

```python
skeleton_start = int(min(y_spline))
skeleton_end = int(max(y_spline))
```
Next, the midline is approximated from the spline via a sliding window to calculate the median of each bin:

```python
med_x, med_y = [], []
        
bin_size = 100
for start in range(start, end, bin_size):
    end = start + bin_size
    bin_y_val = [x[1] for x in merged_spline if start <= x[1] <= end]
    bin_x_val = [x[0] for x in merged_spline if start <= x[1] <= end]
    
    med_y.append(np.median(bin_y_val)) 
    med_x.append(np.median(bin_x_val))

```
Here is a visualization of the spline mapped to the skeleton:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.plot(merged_spline[:,0], merged_spline[:,1], 'y.')
ax.yaxis.set_inverted(True)
```
![alt text](/demo/spline.png)

### Rotating the root

Now that we have the median co-ordinates to approximate the root midline, we can calculate the angle required to rotate the root such that the root tip/end of the root in frame is pointing downwards.

Here, I calculate the change in y and change in x of the endpoints of the root midline:
```python
dy = max(med_y) - min(med_y)
dx = med_x[0] - med_x[-1]
```

Next, I calculate the angle to rotate the root relative to the vertical, and rotate the image.  
The rotated image is resized with `resize=True` to preserve resolution of the original input image.

```python
angle = np.rad2deg(np.arctan(dx/dy))
    
rotated_mask = rotate(root_labeled_cleaned, angle, preserve_range=True, resize=True, mode='constant')

plt.imshow(rotated_mask)

```
![alt text](demo/rotated_mask.png)

### Repeat of previous steps

Now we have a rotated mask of the original image, the previous steps are repeated:
- extract the root
- clean the root 
- skeletonize the root 
- approximate the midline of the rotated root skeleton

All repeated steps are illustrated here for convenience:

```python
### Extract root

rotated_root_mask = (rotated_mask == 2)

clean_root_rotated_labeled, rotated_count = label(rotated_root_mask, connectivity=2, return_num=True)

if rotated_count > 1: # if more than 1 root is present    
    rotated_root_labeled_cleaned, new_count = clean_root_chunk(clean_root_rotated_labeled)

### Skeletonize root
skeleton_rotated = skeletonize(rotated_root_labeled_cleaned)

skeleton_y_rot, skeleton_x_rot = np.nonzero(skeleton_rotated)

### Map points to skeleton
t_range_rot  = np.arange(len(skeleton_x_rot))
x_spline_rot = CubicSpline(t_range_rot, skeleton_x_rot)(t_range_rot)
y_spline_rot = CubicSpline(t_range_rot, skeleton_y_rot)(t_range_rot)

merged_spline_rot = np.array(list(zip(x_spline_rot, y_spline_rot)))
skeleton_start_rot = int(min(y_spline_rot))
skeleton_end_rot = int(max(y_spline_rot))

### Sliding window to approximate midline 
med_x_rot, med_y_rot = [], []
bin_size = 100

for start in range(skeleton_start_rot, skeleton_end_rot, bin_size):
    end = start + bin_size
    bin_y_val_rot = [x[1] for x in merged_spline_rot if start <= x[1] <= end]
    bin_x_val_rot = [x[0] for x in merged_spline_rot if start <= x[1] <= end]
    
    med_y_rot.append(np.median(bin_y_val_rot)) 
    med_x_rot.append(np.median(bin_x_val_rot))
```

As you can see, the code is exactly the same as previously described, just with a few variable changes. This chunk calculates the approximated midline of the rotated root skeleton.

### Straightening the root

To obtain accurate root hair measurements, the curved root needs to be straightened as much as possible. The root will be straightened by warping. 

First, I need to add endpoints to the image to ensure all of the image is warped. Here, I define the end and second end points of each end of the rotated root skeleton:

```python
points = np.array(list(zip(med_x_rot, med_y_rot)))

first_point = points[0] 
second_point = points[1]

last_point = points[-1]
seclast_point = points[-2]
```

Next, I generate new endpoints beyond the image boundary, based on euclidean distances between the previous points. This section is heavily inspired the following stackoverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73614379/how-do-i-use-piecewise-af%EF%AC%81ne-transformation-to-straighten-curved-text-line-cont

```python
def generate_endpoints(pointA: list, pointB: list, length: int) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Generate new end points
    """
    len_pApB = euclidean(pointA, pointB)
    n_x = pointA[0] + ((pointA[0]-pointB[0]) / len_pApB*length)
    n_y = pointA[1] + ((pointA[1]-pointB[1]) / len_pApB*length)

    return n_x, n_y

first_x, first_y = generate_endpoints(first_point, second_point, 100)
last_x, last_y = generate_endpoints(last_point, seclast_point, 100)

# Add new end points to the beginning/end of points array
points = np.vstack([[first_x, first_y], points])
points = np.vstack([points,[last_x, last_y]])

plt.imshow(rotated_root_labeled_cleaned)
plt.scatter(points[:,0], points[:,1], s=10, marker='x')
plt.scatter(points[:,0][0], points[:,1][0], color='red', s=20)
plt.scatter(points[:,0][0], points[:,1][-1], color='red', s=20)
```
Here, this plot illustrates the addition of new endpoints (red circles) at the end of all the midline co-ordinates of the rotated root mask (blue X's).
