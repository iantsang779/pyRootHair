## Installation instructions

`mkdir ~/pyroothair`  
`git clone https://github.com/iantsang779/pyRootHair`  
`cd pyroothair`  

## How to use pyRootHair

WIP.

## An in-depth dive into the pyRootHair workflow

This section is for users that are curious about how pyRootHair extracts traits from a given input image. In essence, this is a step by step process of the functions and logic within the source code. For this demonstration, I will be using the demo image `karim_demo.png` and the corresponding binary segmentation mask `karim_demo_mask.png`.

#### Loading the necessary libraries

First, we import the required libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import imageio.v3 as iio

from skimage.measure import label, regionprops
from skimage.morphology import skeletonize
from skimage.transform import rotate, warp, PiecewiseAffineTransform
from scipy.ndimage import convolve
from scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean
from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline
from statsmodels.nonparametric.smoothers_lowess import lowess
```

For reference, the following versions were used at the time of writing this tutorial:

- python: 3.12.3
- numpy: 2.0.2
- pandas: 2.2.3
- matplotlib: 3.9.0
- imageiov3: 2.36.1
- scikit-image: 0.24.0
- scipy: 1.14.1
- statsmodels: 0.14.4

#### Viewing the demo image and binary mask

Here, we first read in the raw image, and corresponding binary mask. The mask was generated by the integrated nnUNet segmentation model within pyRootHair.  

Since the mask is an array of [0, 1, 2], it will show up as a black image.   

This image was specifically chosen for a few reasons:

- Noise in the background (agar fragments)
- Root is inherently curved and not directly oriented downwards
- Presence of non-primary root sections

```python
image = iio.imread('~/Images/Wheat/Raw/karim_demo.png')
mask = iio.imread('~/Images/Wheat/Masks/karim_demo_mask.png')

fig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(15,10))
ax[0].imshow(image)
ax[0].set_title('Raw Image')
ax[1].imshow(mask)
ax[1].set_title('Binary Mask')
```

From now on, I will process the binary mask.
